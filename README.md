Objectives:
  -Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset to understand its characteristics, distributions, correlations, and outliers.
  -Visualize the findings using various plots to gain insights into the data.

Key Activities:
  1.Data Loading: Load the dataset using pandas.
  2.Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, duplicates, and any inconsistencies in the data.
  3.Data Exploration:
    -Summary Statistics: Compute summary statistics like mean, median, standard deviation, etc.
    -Distribution Analysis: Plot histograms and box plots to understand the distribution of variables.
    -Correlation Analysis: Compute and visualize correlations between variables using heatmaps.
    -Outlier Detection: Identify and visualize outliers using scatter plots and box plots.
  4.Data Visualization: Use matplotlib and seaborn to create various plots for visualizing the data.

Technologies Used:
  -Python: The programming language used for the analysis.
  -pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
  -numpy: For numerical operations.
  -matplotlib: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
  -seaborn: For statistical data visualization based on matplotlib.

Key Insights:
  1.Distribution of Variables: Histograms and box plots revealed the distribution of the data, highlighting skewness and the presence of outliers.
  2.Correlation between Variables: Heatmaps showed significant correlations between certain pairs of variables, indicating potential relationships.
  3.Outliers: Scatter plots and box plots identified outliers, which could be important for further analysis or modeling.
